# The Harness — concepts & vocabulary (read first)

This file is the **conceptual anchor** for the AI development setup in this repo.
It fixes what each word means so we never mix three different things that all get
called "harness". When in doubt about a term, this file wins.

## Agent = Model + Harness

The model (Claude) has the intelligence but, on its own, has no loop, no memory,
no tools, no guardrails. The **harness** is everything around the model that turns
it into a reliable worker. We are doing **harness engineering**: building the
controls that make an AI agent effective _in this specific codebase_.

> **We do not build the harness runtime.** The execution loop, tool routing, and
> "when to stop" are provided by **Claude Code**. We engineer the _controls and
> context_ that plug into it. Don't reinvent the loop.

## Three meanings of "harness" — keep them separate

| Term                   | What it is                                                    | In this repo                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test harness**       | Scaffolding that _runs tests_                                 | vitest / nx — already exists, not our project                 |
| **Evaluation harness** | Runs an agent and _scores it_ on a benchmark (e.g. SWE-bench) | **Not** what we build. We evaluate the _code_, not the agent. |
| **Agent harness**      | The controls + context around the model                       | **This is our project.**                                      |

If we ever want to measure "how well does the AI perform here", that is a separate
**evaluation harness** — do not fold it into this one.

## Our vocabulary (use these words)

- **Harness** — the whole environment around the model (Claude Code + everything
  in this repo's `docs/ai`, `.claude`, and `scripts/harness`).
- **Guides** — _feedforward_ controls: knowledge that steers the agent **before** it
  acts. Docs, rules, conventions. → `docs/ai/*`, the `CLAUDE.md` files, and the
  context-injecting hooks (`session-context`, `prompt-reminder`).
- **Sensors** — _feedback_ controls: checks that observe output and feed it back so
  the agent can self-correct. → `scripts/harness/sensors/*` (and the lint hook).
  - **Computational sensors** — deterministic, ms–seconds: lint, typecheck, test,
    `gaps`, `impact`, `perf`, `quality`.
  - **Inferential sensors** — AI/semantic, slower (none yet; e.g. a future
    semantic review would go here).
- **Guardrails** — sensors that **veto** an action, not just report. → the
  `pre-edit-guard` (PreToolUse) and `quality-gate` (Stop) hooks.
- **Generators** — productivity tools that _write code_ (classic "scaffolding").
  Not a control. → the planned `generate-feature` tool. (We avoid the word
  "scaffold" for this, because "scaffold" means something else — see below.)

### Reserved words we deliberately avoid

- **"Scaffold"** — in agent-harness literature this is the _behaviour-defining
  layer_ (system prompt, tool descriptions, context policy). To avoid collisions
  we don't use "scaffold" for code generation; we say **generator** /
  `generate-feature`.

## One engine, many surfaces

Each sensor's logic lives **once** (in `scripts/harness/sensors/`, with the
project-agnostic engine + hook runners extracted to the portable **`@harness/core`**
package under `tools/harness/`). Hooks, the CLI, and skills are just _surfaces_
that invoke it — they never re-implement it. (E.g. the `quality-gate` guardrail
calls the `quality` sensor.)

The tool catalog is declared **once** in `scripts/harness/manifest.mjs` (the
single source of truth) and grouped by purpose — **check** (the gate) / analyze /
secure / inspect / meta. The CLI, the Stop-hook gate, `doctor`, the docs and the
future MCP namespaces all DERIVE from it. Project-specific values live in
`harness.config.mjs`; domain-coupled sensors (`rules`, `formal`) are plugins.

See [sensors.md](sensors.md) for the sensor catalog and how to run each, and
[tools/harness/README.md](../../tools/harness/README.md) for adopting the core in
another project.

## Portability (Claude + Codex)

The harness is **agent-agnostic by design** — the substance lives in the Node CLI
(`scripts/harness/`) and CI, not in any one assistant. Only the _delivery surface_
differs per agent:

| Layer       | Claude Code                          | Codex / others                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Context     | auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` + nested      | reads `AGENTS.md` (same rules)         |
| Run checks  | hooks + skills fire                  | run `pnpm harness <cmd>` / `pnpm gate` |
| Enforcement | local Stop hook **+ git hooks + CI** | **git hooks** (commit/push) **+ CI**   |

The same checks run from **four triggers, one engine**: Claude hooks · git hooks
(`.githooks/`, wired by the `prepare` script → `core.hooksPath`) · the
`pnpm harness`/`pnpm gate` CLI · CI. Git hooks make local enforcement
agent-independent (Codex/Cursor/humans), not just Claude.

### Checklist when changing the harness

1. **Logic goes in the engine** (`scripts/harness/sensors/` or `generators/`),
   never embedded in a hook or skill — those stay thin surfaces.
2. **New sensor/generator → declare it in `scripts/harness/manifest.mjs`** (the
   single source of truth: name, group, blocking, script) so it's reachable as
   `pnpm harness <cmd>` and picked up by `doctor` (i.e. by Codex/CI/humans, not
   Claude-only). The CLI + Stop gate derive from the manifest.
3. **New skill → it must wrap a `pnpm harness <cmd>`** (a skill is never the only
   way to run something).
4. **Update `AGENTS.md`** when you add a capability or a rule (Codex's entry point).
5. **Run `pnpm harness doctor`** — green means it's still portable.

This is **self-enforcing**, so it can't silently rot:

- `doctor` is **auto-discovering** — it scans `sensors/`+`generators/` and fails if
  any script isn't wired into the CLI (and vice-versa), plus checks `AGENTS.md`,
  skill→CLI mapping, git hooks, and `capabilities.json`↔ESLint.
- `doctor` also checks that the sensors **still see the code** — every configured
  scan root resolves to real source, project discovery reaches every
  `project.json`, and each project carries both a `layer:*` and a `vertical:*`
  tag. Wiring checks alone cannot catch this: after ADR-0019 moved the apps and
  vertical libs, `impact` stayed wired, ran fine and reported green while
  classifying 10 of 16 projects as `unknown` — which downstream reads as "no
  impact" rather than "not found". **A sensor that scans nothing is
  indistinguishable from one that finds nothing**, and only the silent version
  is dangerous. The floor is deliberately ZERO rather than a percentage against
  a baseline: a drop-threshold fires on every legitimate deletion, and a noisy
  check is one people learn to skip. Project discovery is shared
  (`scripts/harness/project-graph.mjs`) so `doctor` exercises the same code
  `impact` depends on, and counted against an independent walk so a bug in the
  walker cannot conceal itself.
- The **Stop hook runs `doctor` automatically when the diff touches the harness**
  (`scripts/harness/`, `.claude/`, `.githooks/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `package.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `capabilities.json`) — so a portability
  break blocks delivery locally.
- **CI runs `doctor` on every push** — the backstop for any agent.
