# Access — business rules

> Covers the EXISTING giro's API (\`apps/bison/api\`) and vocabulary — each giro gets
> its own generated rules doc (ADR-0017).

Human-readable representation of the authorization system (ADR-0010). Every
table below is derived from — or executed against — the real code.

## Principles

- **Roles expand to permissions; temporary grants for elevation.** A membership
  carries **roles** (named bundles, ADR-0011) that expand to the flat
  action+scope permission list the policy core evaluates; the presets below are
  the seed templates (ADR-0012/0013). Audited, expiring **grants** add narrow
  elevations (impersonation). Nothing ever asks "is this user an owner?".
- **Deny by default, fail closed.** Anything not explicitly allowed is denied;
  a disabled account or revoked/expired session denies everything.
- **The token never authorizes.** A JWT only proves identity; permissions,
  grants and statuses are loaded fresh from the database on every request, so
  revocation is immediate.
- **Every sensitive action is audited atomically** — the mutation and its
  audit event commit in one transaction.

## Durations

${renderDurations(jwtExpirySeconds())}

## Who can do what (presets)

${renderPresetMatrix()}

Presets are starting bundles: an owner can change any membership's
permissions afterwards (\`permissions.update\` is root-equivalent — whoever
holds it can grant themselves anything *within the coherence rules below*).

## What can live inside a customer organization

${renderDelegableActions()}

## Impersonation

${renderImpersonationRules()}

## Decisions, executed

The rows below are **run through the real policy core** when this document is
generated — they are behavior, not documentation:

${renderDecisionMatrix()}

## API surface

${procedures}

Enforcement never relies on this table's "required action": every use case
re-authorizes itself with the concrete resource in hand.

## Audit events

${renderAuditEvents()}

## Owner bootstrap

With no root admin in the system, the first sign-in whose email equals
\`BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_EMAIL\` (env, read only by the API composition root) is
promoted to owner exactly once, emitting \`owner.bootstrapped\`. Afterwards
the variable is inert.
