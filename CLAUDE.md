# CLAUDE.md — AI development harness (index)

This file is the **router**. It is auto-loaded as context. It is intentionally
short: it tells you _where to look_, not everything at once. Read the linked doc
only when the task needs it (progressive disclosure).

> **Acme** is a Clean + Hexagonal TypeScript **monorepo shipping multiple
> isolated business verticals** (_giros_) — each vertical owns its dashboard +
> apps + API + auth/DB project, and one vertical never references another
> (ADR-0017). Its code lives under `apps/<vertical>/` and
> `libs/verticals/<vertical>/`, tagged `vertical:<name>`; shared engines are
> tagged `vertical:core`. That tag is enforced by lint, not by review
> (ADR-0019). Shared code is compile-time libs only; each app ships to Web,
> PWA, iOS, Android, Windows and macOS from one codebase. Business logic is
> portable: it imports no framework, browser, DB or SDK.

Machine-readable layer rules (use cases, not prose): [docs/ai/capabilities.json](docs/ai/capabilities.json).

## The 30-second model

```
apps/*  → may use everything (composition roots; the only place adapters are wired)
ui      → application, shared            (never infrastructure / platform)
infra   → application, domain, shared
platform→ application, domain, shared
application → domain, shared
domain  → shared
shared  → nothing
```

Dependencies point **inward**. Violations fail `nx lint` — the architecture
cannot silently rot.

A second, orthogonal axis crosses it (ADR-0019). Every project carries one
`layer:*` tag **and** one `vertical:*` tag, and both are enforced:

```
vertical:core   → vertical:core only        (shared code knows no vertical)
vertical:bison  → vertical:bison + core     (never a sibling vertical)
vertical:lab    → vertical:lab   + core
```

**Inside a screen** the flow is one-way: `UI → Store → Controller → Use case →
Domain`. Components read ViewModels and dispatch; cross-module orchestration
lives in headless **flows** (`libs/application/src/flows`), never in a component
or a store. See [docs/ai/flows.md](docs/ai/flows.md).

## Non-negotiables (full list in constraints.md)

- **No classes, no decorators.** Pure functions + factory functions only.
- **Return `Result`/`Either`, never `throw`** for expected failures.
- **`domain` and `application` import no React, browser, DB, HTTP, auth, native
  SDK or state libs (Zustand).** They run in plain Node; stores live in `ui`.
- **Ports are `type`s; adapters are factory functions.** DI is explicit
  parameters, wired only in `apps/*/composition-root.ts`.

## Canonical template

The `Item` example threads every layer. Copy its shape for new features:
domain → [libs/domain/src/example](libs/domain/src/example) ·
use cases/ports → [libs/application/src/example](libs/application/src/example) ·
adapters → [libs/infrastructure/src/persistence](libs/infrastructure/src/persistence) ·
screen → [libs/verticals/lab/ui/src/example](libs/verticals/lab/ui/src/example) ·
wiring → [apps/lab/web/src/composition-root.ts](apps/lab/web/src/composition-root.ts).

For a whole new **vertical**, the template is the `lab` vertical itself — copy
[libs/verticals/lab](libs/verticals/lab) + [apps/lab](apps/lab), which is a
complete world (its own `AccessConfig`, DI bundle, dashboard and client apps).
Lab is built and tested like any other vertical, so it cannot go stale, and it
doubles as the canary: bison-specific code leaking into a shared lib stops lab
compiling. (`Item`'s domain/application/infrastructure still sit in core — a
documented exception, see ADR-0019.)

## Quality gate (run before declaring work done)

```bash
pnpm harness quality        # lint + typecheck + test on affected projects (a sensor)
```

The same gate is enforced automatically as a **guardrail** (the Stop hook) — see
[docs/ai/harness.md](docs/ai/harness.md). Other sensors: `pnpm harness gaps|impact|perf`.
