/**
 * Server-only `IdentityPurger`: erases a Supabase identity via the GoTrue admin
 * API. Needs the project's SECRET key, so it may only be wired in a Node
 * composition root (apps/bison/api) — never the browser.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED on every non-2xx: nothing is reported as deleted unless GoTrue
 * says it deleted it. A 404 is a failure too, not a silent success — being
 * asked to erase a user that is not there means our view of the world is wrong,
 * and that is exactly when a destructive operation should stop.
